# Introduction
#### Dataset 
The dataset contains 997 vacancies related to machine learning. 
Even though the name and official description of dataset indicate that all vacancies are in the United States, 
the dataset also contains vacancies outside the US.  
Most of the vacancies are from 2024 and 2025. Each observation contains:
- ID
- Date job was posted
- The city a company is located in
- The region a company is located in
- Company name
- Company description
- Job description 
- Seniority level
- Job title

The complete dataset, along with a more extensive description is found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/job-postings-us)

#### Unsupervised Learning Problem
For this project I'm going use the description of a vacancy to predict its seniority level. 
Most of the vacancies contain at least 400 words and I'm curious whether (a combination of) 
these expressions have predictive power regarding the seniority of a function.

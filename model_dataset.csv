336,1,0,"About HightouchHightouch’s mission is to empower everyone to take action on their data. Hundreds of companies, including Autotrader, Calendly, Cars.com, Monday.com, and PetSmart, trust Hightouch to power their growth.We pioneered the Composable Customer Data Platform (CDP), which lets companies use their own data warehouse to collect, prepare, and activate customer data for marketing personalization and business operations. Our new AI Decisioning platform goes a step further, allowing marketers to set goals and guardrails that AI agents can then use to personalize 1:1 customer interactions. Traditionally, only technical teams had the skills to access and use customer data. With Hightouch, every business user can deliver personalized customer experiences, optimize performance marketing, and move faster by leveraging data and AI across their organization.Our team focuses on making a meaningful impact for our customers. We approach challenges with a first-principles mindset, move quickly and efficiently, and treat each other with compassion and kindness.

Our Series C put us at a $1.2B valuation, and we are backed by leading investors such as Sapphire Ventures, Amplify Partners, ICONIQ Growth, Bain Capital Ventures, Y-Combinator, and Afore Capital.About The RoleWe’re looking to hire a machine learning engineer as we expand our data activation products to include an intelligence layer. While hundreds of companies use Hightouch today to sync data into their SaaS systems to automate and improve operations, there’s a lot of surface area we haven’t touched in helping companies figuring out which customers to message, what content to put in messages, and when to send messages. A lot of this work today is done manually through intuition and guesswork, and we believe that adding machine learning could have a step function impact for our customers. And given our access to data warehouses and databases, Hightouch is perfectly placed to make use of a company’s customer data in building a powerful intelligence layer.Some of the problems we’ll be working on include:Personalization and Product Recommendation: There are often many options for what content a company could message a user with, including which products to show from catalogues. Given this large state space, how can Hightouch help personalize messages with the most relevant content for each user?Automated Experimentation: Helping companies intelligently navigate and automate experiments across the extensive number of options for messaging customers.Predictive Audiences: Building models to predict which users are most likely to convert, churn, or take desired actions.Content Generation: Particularly with recent advances in LLMs, how can we help marketers generate text, images, and creatives that are compelling to their customers?Budget Optimization: Helping companies assess which marketing spend is driving the most incremental conversions, and where the marginal CAC is lowest.As an early machine learning engineer, you will help build comprehensive solutions to the above domains from scratch.

However, these are all implemented in Python, meaning they aren't as easily accessible to JavaScript/TypeScript developers. So, in order to grow the Hugging Face ecosystem, we decided to build projects like transformers.js and huggingface.js with the primary goal of bridging the gap between web development and machine learning. WebML (Web Machine Learning) unlocks a range of new possibilities for building web applications by enabling models to run locally in the browser. Combining on-device machine learning with the plethora of APIs that browsers provide, empowers developers to create low-latency, interactive, and privacy-focused applications that can scale and reach users without them needing to install anything! This internship operates at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and open-source community building. The focus will be to expand the Hugging Face ecosystem to web developers through the creation and maintenance of easy-to-use JS/TS machine learning libraries. By the end of the internship, the candidate will have touched on many aspects of web machine learning, including: converting and optimizing models for in-browser inference (ONNX, quantization), enabling models to run in-browser at near-native speeds (WebGPU, WebNN, WASM), building demo applications to showcase new features, and fostering a collaborative open-source community.About YouIf you love open-source but also have an eye for art and creativity, are passionate about making complex technology more accessible to engineers and artists, and want to contribute to one of the fastest-growing ML ecosystems, then we can't wait to see your application!If you're interested in joining us, but don't tick every box above, we still encourage you to apply!
